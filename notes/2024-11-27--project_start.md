We started the project today.
We decided to attempt to follow a strict test-driven development approach.
Ideally, whenever we add, remove or edit code, we should first provide a test or experiment
that shows whatever is lacking in the current codebase.
That means either making a test that fails, demonstrating a bug, edge case or lacking functionality.
Or a time measurement that demonstrates potentially inefficient execution.

To honor this, I will first work on some automatic data generation facility.
